// ==============================================
// Different common types of runtime complexities
// ==============================================
// -Constant evaluates to: O(1)
// -Logarithmic evaluates to: O(log(n))
// -Linear evaluates to: O(n)
// -Quasilinear evaluates to: O(n * log(n))
// -Quadratic evaluates to: O(n ^ 2)
// -Exponential evaluates to: O(2 ^ n)


// ============================
// What does each runtime mean?
// ============================

// Constant
// With a constant runtime no matter how many elements we are working with the algorithm or operations
// will always take the same amount of time.

// Logarithmic
// With a logrithmic runtime if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesn't double the amount of work, 
// it is considered logrithmic
