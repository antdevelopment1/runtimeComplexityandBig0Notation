// Techniques to solving problems
// Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
// =================================
// Understanding the Problem Step 1:
// =================================
// Can I restate the problem into my won words

// What are the input that go into the problem

// What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem

// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words do I have enough infornmation to solve thr problem

// How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem

// ==========================
// Concrete Examples Step 2:
// ==========================

// Write a function that takes a string and returns counts of each character in the string

// Start with simple examples

// Progress to more complex examples

// Explore examples with empty inputs

// Explore examples with invalid inputs
